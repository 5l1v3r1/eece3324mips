## Description

This is a miniature implementation of a single cycle MIPS processor
architecture, supporting the following instructions:

- add, addi, addiu, slt
- beq, j
- lw, sw
- hlt (artificial)

## Testing

`cpu_tb.v' is the main testbench to run, and was tested using a simulation
time of 15015 ns. `memory1.v' and `MinMax.hexdump' are provided testing
files.
